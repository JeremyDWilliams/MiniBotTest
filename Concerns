concerns to watch for:

Memory Usage: Depending on the capabilities of your Arduino board, the code may consume a significant amount of memory, especially if you're dealing with large arrays or performing complex calculations. Keep an eye on memory usage, especially if you encounter unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

Timing Issues: The code includes delays and button press handling that rely on accurate timing. If your system requires precise timing or real-time responsiveness, you may need to adjust the delay durations or use alternative timing mechanisms.

Error Handling: Error handling is minimal in the provided code. Make sure to add robust error handling to handle unexpected situations, such as SD card initialization failures or servo malfunctions.

Servo Calibration: Ensure that the home position and servo range are calibrated correctly for your specific servo motors. Incorrect calibration can result in unexpected servo behavior or physical damage to the servos.

PID Tuning: The PID constants (Kp, Ki, Kd) may need tuning to achieve optimal performance for your system. Experiment with different values to achieve smooth and stable servo control without overshooting or oscillations.

File System Management: The code assumes a simple file naming convention ("Skit-X.txt") for recording and playback. Make sure to manage file naming and storage properly, especially if you're dealing with a large number of recordings or limited storage space.

Hardware Compatibility: Ensure that the code is compatible with your specific hardware components, including Arduino board, servos, SD card module, buttons, LEDs, and potentiometers. Check pin assignments, voltage levels, and communication protocols to avoid compatibility issues.
